## HOW TO USE:

Now using UEFITool, you only need to find each module by it's name or GUID, open the patched folder, and use "only" the AML file to replace the Original file with it. In UEFITool, double click the module GUID generally as "Freeform" then you right click and choose "Replace Body" as shown in this screenshot. 
Note: that each module that contain more than one file, are numbered from top to botom as 1, 2, 3 etc... in their folders respectively.

UEFITool takes care of files to be replaced and convert automatically the extension as raw format. For the AmiBoardInfo that contains DSDT inside, you need to replace the PE32 Image inside the AmiBoardInfo module with the file named "AmiBoardInfo.bin" and do not use AML file for that, screenshot is what to follow

Once you've fully replaced the file on their own modules, except the folders that do not contain "ASL5.1 Patched" folder which don't need to be used, you can save your BIOS, copy/paste on pen drive, and do a flash using End Keyboard button once you restart your motherboard.
